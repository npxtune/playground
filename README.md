# Testing playground to learn C
This repo follows my studies through the K&R "The C Programming Language" (Second Edition)

Most exercises can be found in /src -> "section" (eg: src/K&R2.9).

## Requirements for Builds
Based on the CLion C project template. CMake + ninja needed, CLion recommended for builds.
